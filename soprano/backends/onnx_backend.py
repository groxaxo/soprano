ONNX and OpenVINO backend for Soprano TTS CPU inference.

NOTE: These backend classes are currently unused. The ONNX and OpenVINO
functionality is implemented directly in soprano/tts.py. This file is
kept for reference and potential future refactoring.

For actual ONNX/OpenVINO usage, see soprano.tts.SopranoTTS with 
backend='onnx_cpu' or backend='openvino_cpu'.
